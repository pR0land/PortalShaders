# Portal Shader (Unreal Engine)

A technical prototype made in **Unreal Engine**, inspired by *Valveâ€™s Portal*, exploring how to replicate the iconic **see-through portal effect** using custom materials and render textures.
The goal was to create a functioning **portal visualization system** where the player can look through one portal and see the real-time view from another.
